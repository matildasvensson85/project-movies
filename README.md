# Project Movies

We created a multi-page movie site using React Router, useState, useEffect and useParams hooks. We added a navbar with a dropdown for sorting the movies, a loading spinner when fetching the movies, a first loading page and an error page. Pair programming by Matilda Svensson and Jessika Hage.
